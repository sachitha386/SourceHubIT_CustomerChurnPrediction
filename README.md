For your **README.md**, you want it to be clear, informative, and structured so anyone visiting your GitHub project immediately understands what it does, how to run it, and what’s inside. Here’s a **recommended structure with content** for your Customer Churn Prediction project:

---

# Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview

This project predicts whether a customer will leave (churn) a service based on behavioral and account data. It demonstrates the complete **machine learning workflow** from **data preprocessing** to **model training, evaluation, and sample predictions**.

---

## Technologies Used

* **Python** – Core programming language
* **Pandas & NumPy** – Data manipulation and analysis
* **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning models and evaluation
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
* **Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)** – Handling imbalanced datasets

---

## Features

* Handle **missing values** and encode categorical data
* Train **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** models
* Evaluate models using **accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC curve**
* Make **sample predictions** for new customers
* Optional handling of **imbalanced datasets** with SMOTE

---

## Dataset

The dataset is a **synthetic customer churn dataset** (1000 records) with the following columns:

* `tenure` – Number of months the customer has been with the company
* `MonthlyCharges` – Monthly subscription fee
* `Contract` – Contract type (Month-to-month, One year, Two year)
* `PaymentMethod` – Payment method (e.g., Electronic check, Credit card)
* `Churn` – Target variable (Yes/No)

---

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Customer-Churn-Prediction.git
```

2. Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn imbalanced-learn
```

3. Open `churn_model.ipynb` in **Jupyter Notebook** and run the cells.

---

## Sample Predictions

The model can predict churn for new customers and outputs both:

* **Churn / Not Churn**
* **Probability of churn**

Example:

```text
Customer 1: Churn (Probability: 0.78)
Customer 2: Not Churn (Probability: 0.12)
```

---

## Evaluation Metrics

* **Accuracy** – Overall correctness of the model
* **Confusion Matrix** – Detailed prediction results
* **Classification Report** – Precision, Recall, F1-Score
* **ROC Curve & AUC** – Model performance visualization

---

## Outcome

* Predict whether a customer is likely to churn
* Visualize model performance
* Can be extended to real datasets for practical applications
